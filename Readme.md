#### To test source code:
clone the repository and run codes in "test\cpgWalkingModel" folder. 

- src: contains walking models and helper functions. We used "walksw2cpg" model (which inherits "walksw2") for the paper.
- test: contains source codes to run the simulation and produce demo video. Use "CPGpaper_Ushape_clean" to test walking performances. 
- resource: contains other types of resources for the repository.
